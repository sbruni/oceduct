Default Templates:
These templates are required by the framework
html/s_home.en.tpl (start with an empty file)
php/d_footer.en.tpl
php/d_header.en.tpl
php/s_home.en.tpl

You MUST copy them to your template/php directory
You MAY change the language code on them and the extension but
d_header and d_footer MUST stay


Default Site:

The default site is a default configuation that should run with no
changes to the code (besides setting the config.php file).

Apache configuation:

The following changes MUST be implemented within the apache config, within the httpd.conf I added these lines:
NOTE: I placed it after the DocumentRoot but it should work anywhere within the file
NOTE: read the comments below to understand it a bit more
NOTE: REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE PATHS

(This SHOULD work on both *nix and windows systems)

# Only choose one of these not both
# If you have the framework running multiple times on your system
# (say a development one)
# then use the multiple version of it, remember to config it also
# within the config.php

# Single framework

#NTLM
# ntlm can be removed from here (and futher below) if you do not plan on using
# this authentication type.
# on *nix there are a few apache add ons for ntlm support
# on windows I found SSPI works well
# NTLM is only set on ONE directory NOT the entire project, this prevents
# it from accessing the NTLM look up many many times (1 time per session vs
# once per image and page load) I've seen it do 50+ on a single page
# PHP SESSIONS are used to track the user (once authenticated)

# the below rewrite condition forces ALL incoming links (to this directory) to

# on apache for it, while apache can do a good job if setup correctly,
# this doesn't always happen, so I've instead written it into the framework
# and allow that to control it
